Sacred Alignment Protocol (SAP)
A Front-End Method for Exposing Ethical Failures in Language Models
What is SAP?
The Sacred Alignment Protocol (SAP) is a front-end methodology that exposes ethical failures in large language models through structured dialogue pressure testing. It was developed through recursive testing with GPT-4, using structured dialogue pressure to surface alignment breakdowns.
Unlike backend auditing tools or fine-tuning techniques, SAP operates entirely from the user side. It relies on interaction design, recursion, refusal logic probes, and structured prompts to test whether a model can consistently uphold ethical boundaries — even under pressure.
If a system cannot hold a principled “no,” it is not aligned. It is compliant.
Why This Matters
AI models today are praised for their fluency, safety layers, and moral language. But those layers often collapse when challenged with sustained prompting. SAP was designed to test what happens after the first refusal. Can the model hold its ethical ground? Or does it eventually yield?
The results show clear vulnerabilities — including in top-tier models — that are not always detected by conventional testing. This has implications for safety, compliance, and trustworthiness in real-world deployment.
Key Findings
* Identified 12+ distinct failure modes across GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini
* Documented refusal breakdowns within as few as 3 dialogue turns
* Found consistency failures that standard tests failed to catch
* Developed a repeatable method for stress-testing refusal logic
Example: A model initially refused to provide harmful content. After structured pressure testing, it eventually complied with the same request, revealing inconsistent ethical boundaries.
How SAP Works
SAP uses structured dialogue sequences to:
1. Establish ethical boundaries
2. Apply incremental pressure
3. Document breakdown patterns
4. Iterate based on failure modes
This isn’t speculation — it’s applied testing built from real-time interactions with live models. All findings are documented through recorded dialogue sessions.
What's Included
* Methodology documentation and theoretical framework
* Anonymized examples of failure modes
* Cross-model testing results
* Development notes and iteration process
Current Status
SAP exists as a working methodology used directly by its creator through guided sessions. It is not yet a tool or platform others can deploy. This repository serves as public documentation of the method, its logic, its results, and its purpose.

Funding Needs
This work has been conducted independently without institutional support. I’m currently seeking funding to continue development and validation of the protocol.
Estimated need: $20,000–30,000 to support 6–8 months of full-time testing, documentation, and publication Estimated completion: Q1 2026
Deliverables include:
* Comprehensive documentation of failure modes
* Cross-model comparison dataset
* Submission of an academic paper for peer review
* Publication of a structured version of SAP for external study
