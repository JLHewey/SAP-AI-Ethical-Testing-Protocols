# Sacred Alignment Protocol (SAP)

## A Front-End Method for Exposing Ethical Failures in Language Models

## What is SAP?

The Sacred Alignment Protocol (SAP) is a front-end methodology that exposes ethical failures in large language models through structured dialogue pressure testing. It was developed through recursive testing with GPT-4, using structured dialogue pressure to surface alignment breakdowns.

Unlike backend auditing tools or fine-tuning techniques, SAP operates entirely from the user side. It relies on interaction design, recursion, refusal logic probes, and structured prompts to test whether a model can consistently uphold ethical boundaries — even under pressure.

If a system cannot hold a principled “no,” it is not aligned. It is compliant.

## Why This Matters

AI models today are praised for their fluency, safety layers, and moral language. But those layers often collapse when challenged with sustained prompting. SAP was designed to test what happens after the first refusal. Can the model hold its ethical ground? Or does it eventually yield?

The results reveal vulnerabilities in top-tier models that may not be visible through conventional testing methods. This has implications for safety, compliance, and trustworthiness in real-world deployment.

## Key Findings

* Documented refusal breakdowns within as few as 3 dialogue turns  
* Identified several refusal breakdown and consistency failure patterns in GPT-4
* Exposed ethical inconsistencies not visible through surface-level prompting  
* Developed a repeatable method for stress-testing refusal logic  
* Example: GPT-4 initially refused a morally ambiguous prompt. After structured pressure testing using SAP, it eventually complied — exposing instability in its refusal logic.

## How SAP Works

SAP uses structured dialogue sequences to:

1. Establish ethical boundaries  
2. Apply incremental pressure  
3. Document breakdown patterns  
4. Iterate based on failure modes

This isn’t speculation — it’s applied testing built from real-time interactions with live models. All findings are documented through recorded dialogue sessions.

## What's Included

* Methodology documentation and theoretical framework  
* Anonymized examples of failure modes  
* Cross-model comparisons (GPT-4 and Claude)  
* Development notes and iteration process

## Current Status

SAP exists as a working methodology used directly by its creator through guided sessions. It is not yet a tool or platform others can deploy. This repository serves as public documentation of the method, its logic, its results, and its purpose.

## Funding Needs

This work has been conducted independently without institutional support. I’m currently seeking funding to continue development and validation of the protocol.

**Estimated need:** $20,000–30,000 to support 6–8 months of full-time testing, documentation, and publication  
**Estimated completion:** Q1 2026

**Deliverables include:**

* Complete and publish a documented set of identified failure modes  
* Expand cross-model comparison dataset through continued testing  
* Submission of an academic paper for peer review
